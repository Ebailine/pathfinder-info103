# Adzuna Job Board Integration - Setup Instructions

# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - MIGRATING TO APIFY

**This integration has been disabled and is being replaced with Apify.**

All Adzuna-related code has been commented out and API keys have been removed from environment variables. This document is kept for reference only.

## ✅ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

Your Sivio platform now has a complete real job board powered by Adzuna API with:

- ✅ Real job data from Adzuna (5000 free API calls/month)
- ✅ Advanced filters: Location, Category, Salary Range, Job Type, Remote
- ✅ 1000+ business jobs (Marketing, Sales, Finance, HR, Operations, etc.)
- ✅ Entry-level & Internship focus (0-2 years experience)
- ✅ Daily auto-sync (runs at 2 AM UTC via Vercel cron)
- ✅ Job archiving system (old jobs marked, not deleted)
- ✅ AI contact finder integration (works with real companies)
- ✅ Professional UI with sync status banner

---

## 🚀 REQUIRED ACTIONS (YOU MUST DO THESE)

### STEP 1: Sign Up for Adzuna API (FREE)

1. Go to: **https://developer.adzuna.com/signup**
2. Create a free account
3. Get your **App ID** and **API Key**
4. Free tier includes: 5000 API calls/month (plenty for your needs)

### STEP 2: Add Adzuna Credentials

#### Local Development (.env.local):
```bash
# Already added placeholders - just replace these values:
ADZUNA_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
ADZUNA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

#### Vercel Production:
```bash
vercel env add ADZUNA_APP_ID production
# Paste your App ID when prompted

vercel env add ADZUNA_API_KEY production
# Paste your API Key when prompted
```

### STEP 3: Run Database Migration

Go to your Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```bash
# File: add_adzuna_fields.sql
```

Copy and paste the entire content of `add_adzuna_fields.sql` into the Supabase SQL Editor and execute it.

This adds:
- `adzuna_id` (unique identifier)
- `contract_type`, `category` (job categorization)
- `salary_predicted` (whether salary is estimated)
- `is_archived`, `archived_at` (archiving system)
- `last_synced_at` (sync tracking)
- Indexes for performance

### STEP 4: Deploy to Production

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: integrate Adzuna API with real job board"
git push origin main
vercel --prod
```

### STEP 5: Run Initial Job Sync

After deployment, import your first 1000 jobs:

**Option A: Via Browser**
Visit: `https://sivio.vercel.app/api/jobs/sync` in your browser

**Option B: Via Command Line**
```bash
curl -X POST https://sivio.vercel.app/api/jobs/sync
```

This will take 2-3 minutes and import ~1000 real business jobs.

## 📊 HOW IT WORKS

### Job Sync Process

1. **Daily Auto-Sync** (2 AM UTC via Vercel cron)
   - Fetches new jobs from Adzuna
   - Archives jobs older than 30 days
   - Updates existing jobs
   - Adds new jobs

2. **Manual Sync** (via "Manual Sync" button on /jobs page)
   - Same process as auto-sync
   - Use this for testing or immediate updates

3. **Entry-Level Filtering**
   - Only imports jobs with keywords: "entry level", "junior", "associate", "coordinator", "assistant", "intern", "internship", "graduate", "trainee", "recent graduate"
   - Salary range: $30k-$90k
   - Age: Posted within last 30 days

4. **Business Categories Targeted**
   - Accounting & Finance
   - HR & Recruitment
   - Marketing, Advertising & PR
   - Sales
   - Admin & Secretarial
   - Consultancy
   - Business Management
   - Graduate Programs

### Advanced Filters

Users can filter jobs by:
- **Search**: Keywords in title, company, location, description
- **Job Type**: Internship, Entry Level, Full Time
- **Remote**: Remote Only, On-Site Only, All
- **Location**: City or State (e.g., "New York", "California", "Remote")
- **Category**: Marketing, Sales, Finance, HR, Operations, Business, Consulting
- **Salary Range**: Min/Max salary sliders

### AI Contact Finder Integration

The existing AI contact finder now works seamlessly with real jobs:
- Click any job → "Find Contacts" button
- AI analyzes the real company
- Searches Snov.io for real contacts
- Returns 1-4 best contacts with AI reasoning

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Failed to authenticate with Adzuna"
- Check if ADZUNA_APP_ID and ADZUNA_API_KEY are set
- Verify credentials are correct
- Make sure you signed up at https://developer.adzuna.com/signup

### "No jobs found after sync"
- Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs https://sivio.vercel.app`
- Verify database migration was run
- Try manual sync and watch for errors

### "Sync takes too long"
- This is normal for first sync (1000 jobs)
- Reduce maxJobs parameter to 500 for faster syncs
- Subsequent syncs are faster (only new/updated jobs)

### "Contact finder not working"
- Ensure real jobs are in database
- Check that jobs have company names
- Verify Snov.io credentials are still valid
